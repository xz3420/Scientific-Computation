Jan. 2023 - Apr. 2024

Scientific computation is about how to code efficiently, including the ways of storing data, extracting features, searching through all kinds of data structures.

what I have done:

Project1: Binary Search and Rabin-Karp Algorithm in Data Analysis 
Project2: Data Structure Optimization and Graph Analysis 
Project3: 3D Data Compression and Chaotic System Analysis
